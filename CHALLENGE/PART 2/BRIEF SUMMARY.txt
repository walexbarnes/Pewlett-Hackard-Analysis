Below is a summary of how and why each table was created.

Partone table
Created FROM existing retirement_info table to get all retiring employees
used inner joins with titles table and with salaries table to add that information to retiring employees table

Then: changed partone table
executed a DELETE FROM partone table to remove duplicate titles to get only the most recent title for that employee
NOTE: used a select sanity check to verify deduped tables later on, not storing the info, just checking

Then: Partone_title_agg
used this updated partone table to execute a SELECT COUNT to GROUPBY the number of employees retiring by title

Then: mentee_info
SELECT'ed data from employees table where certain conditions are met (birthday) and received emp number, name based on that condition

Then: current_mentee_no_titles
FROM mentee_info, take emp number, last/first name, execute inner join with dept_emp table where certain conditions are true (is still a current employee), add data from dept_emp table surrounding to and from dates to mentee data

Then: current_mentee_titles
FROM current_mentee_no_titles, execute inner join with titles table to add in titles to the mentee list and return a new table
